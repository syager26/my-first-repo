{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Igt2iADUgfYO"},"source":["# IS-4100 Lab: Predicting NFL Team Performance Using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)\n","\n","## Objective\n","In this lab, you will build a multiple linear regression model to predict a team's **points scored** in a game based on various features like offensive and defensive stats from both past and current NFL seasons.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","- Use the `nfl_data_py` or `nflreadR` package to gather NFL data from past seasons (e.g., 2019-2023) and current in-season data.\n","- Some key features you could look at: passing yards, rushing yards, turnovers, penalties, possession time, and team win-loss record.\n","\n","## Steps\n","\n","### 1. Data Preparation\n","- Load and clean the dataset using `nfl_data_py` or `nflreadR`. Ensure that data from both past and current seasons is available.\n","- Create new features, such as averaging offensive and defensive statistics over the last 3-5 games.\n","- Handle missing values and ensure that the data is ready for analysis.\n","\n","### 2. Feature Selection\n","- Identify key predictors of **points scored** for each game.\n","- Choose at least 5-7 features, such as:\n","  - Passing Yards\n","  - Rushing Yards\n","  - Turnovers\n","  - Penalties\n","  - Possession Time\n","  - Win-Loss Record\n","\n","### 3. Model Construction\n","- Construct a **multiple linear regression** model to predict the number of points scored by a team.\n","- Use statistical tests (e.g., p-values) to evaluate the significance of each predictor.\n","- Analyze the coefficients to understand the contribution of each feature.\n","\n","### 4. Model Evaluation\n","- Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets (e.g., 80/20 split).\n","- Calculate evaluation metrics for your model:\n","  - R² (coefficient of determination)\n","  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n","  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n","- Compare the performance of your multiple regression model to a simple baseline.\n","\n","### 5. Comparison with Simple Linear Regression\n","- Build a simple linear regression model that uses only **total yards gained** as the predictor.\n","- Compare the results of this model with the multiple linear regression model in terms of performance metrics (R², MAE, RMSE).\n","\n","### 6. In-Season Prediction\n","- Use your model with current in-season data to predict the outcome of upcoming NFL games.\n","- After the games are played, compare your model’s predictions with the actual results.\n","\n","## Deliverables\n","- A written report summarizing:\n","  - Model development process\n","  - Feature selection and their importance\n","  - Model performance using evaluation metrics\n","  - Comparisons between multiple and simple linear regression models\n","- Visualizations, including:\n","  - Residual plots\n","  - Predicted vs. Actual points plots\n","- Insights on how well your model generalizes to the current season.\n","\n","## Extra Hint\n","I'd recommend using the data dictionary that can be found [here](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/articles/dictionary_pbp.html) to help with understanding and looking up various variables."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nmsOuyQ6XNps"},"source":["## Load
