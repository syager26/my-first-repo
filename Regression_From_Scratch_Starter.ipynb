        "### **Objective**\n",
        "In this assignment, you will implement a simple linear regression model from scratch using NumPy. You will compute the slope ($m$) and intercept ($b$) of the best-fit line using the least squares method and evaluate your implementation with test data.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Background**\n",
        "Linear regression is used to find the relationship between a dependent variable ($y$) and an independent variable ($x$). The formula for the regression line is:\n",

        "1. **Implement the Linear Regression Formula**\n",
        "   - Write a function `linear_regression(x, y)` that takes two NumPy arrays ($x$) (independent variable) and ($y$) (dependent variable) as inputs.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Evaluate the Model**\n",
        "   - Write a function `r_squared(y_true, y_pred)` to compute the ($R^2$) value, which measures how well the model fits the data:\n",
        "   $$\n",
