        "# IS-4100: NFL Team Performance Analysis using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why are GLMs Useful?**\n",
        "- Flexibility in Modeling Different Types of Data:\n",
        "  - GLMs can handle various types of response variables:\n",
        "    - Continuous (Normal distribution)\n",
        "    - Binary outcomes (Binomial distribution)\n",
        "    - Counts (Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution)\n",
        "    - Proportions and more\n",
        "  - This flexibility allows for modeling data that do not meet the assumptions of traditional linear regression (e.g., non-constant variance, non-normal errors).\n",
        "- Appropriate for Non-Normal Distributions:\n",
        "  - Many real-world datasets have response variables that are skewed, bounded, or discrete.\n",
        "  - GLMs can model these variables appropriately, providing better estimates and inference.\n",
        "- Interpretability:\n",
        "  - Coefficients in GLMs can often be interpreted in terms of odds ratios, risk ratios, or rate ratios, which are meaningful in many applied contexts.\n",
        "- Extensibility:\n",
        "  - GLMs form the foundation for more advanced models like Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), allowing for random effects and hierarchical data structures.\n",
        "- Modeling Non-Linear Relationships:\n",
        "  - Through the use of link functions, GLMs can model non-linear relationships between the predictors and the response variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will analyze NFL team performance data using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). You'll utilize the `nfl_data_py` or `nflfastR` to perform your analysis.\n",
